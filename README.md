# Speech_Text_Convertion

Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) are two of the most interesting Natural Language Processing tasks.

Text-To-Speech is a process in which input text is first analyzed, then processed and understood, and then the text is converted to digital audio and then spoken. Paragraphs, sentences, words, syllables, and letters all use Text-To-Speech (ref).

Speech-to-Text can recognize and translate spoken language into text through computational linguistics. This is also known as computer speech recognition. Linguistic algorithms are used to sort auditory signals and convert them into words using Unicode characters. (ref).

I have used two publicly available wav files downloaded from signalogic - one of a male voice, and the other - of a female voice.

The first step is to install SpeechRecognition library. libportaudio2 is also needed to make SpeechRecognition work in Colab.
