# Speech_Text_Convertion

Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) are two of the most interesting Natural Language Processing tasks.

Text-To-Speech is a process in which input text is first analyzed, then processed and understood, and then the text is converted to digital audio and then spoken. Paragraphs, sentences, words, syllables, and letters all use Text-To-Speech (ref).

Speech-to-Text can recognize and translate spoken language into text through computational linguistics. This is also known as computer speech recognition. Linguistic algorithms are used to sort auditory signals and convert them into words using Unicode characters. (ref).

This Notebook is inspired by a Tutorial on Speech-to-Text conversion of Analytics Vidhya. An attempt was made to record my speech and to convert it to text but it turned out that sounddevice does not work in Google Colab (most likely due to the lack of microphones on its machines).

Instead, I use two publicly available wav files downloaded from signalogic - one of a male voice, and the other - of a female voice.

The first step is to install SpeechRecognition library. libportaudio2 is also needed to make SpeechRecognition work in Colab.
